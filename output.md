# Empirical Patterns of Wealth Preservation Across Major Technological Disruptions

## Introduction

This report analyzes the empirical patterns of wealth preservation across major technological disruptions from 1820 to the present, focusing on specific periods and asset classes. The analysis considers asset returns, volatility metrics, cross-asset correlations, geographic variations, and the impact of geopolitical events and regulatory changes. The report is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of wealth preservation strategies during technological disruptions.

## Periods of Analysis

### Steam/Rail (1820-1870)

The introduction of the telegraph in the 1840s by Samuel Morse and the subsequent development of the transatlantic telegraph cable in 1866 demonstrated the potential of long-distance communication technologies to disrupt existing industries and create new opportunities for wealth preservation. The telegraph's rapid transmission speed and low cost enabled businesses to coordinate operations and access global markets more efficiently, while the cable's completion facilitated instantaneous communication between the US and Europe, revolutionizing international trade and diplomacy.

The telegraph revolution significantly improved communication efficiency, reducing the time it took for information to travel between continents from weeks to days. This was particularly impactful for the cotton trade, where timely information about foreign demand and prices was crucial. The telegraph's real-time capabilities allowed New York traders to adjust export volumes more efficiently, increasing daily cotton exports by 37% and reducing price differences between New York and Liverpool by more than a third.

The telegraph's impact on the cotton trade led to the founding of the New York Cotton Exchange in 1871. This exchange facilitated futures trading, allowing merchants to hedge against price volatility and secure credit more easily. The telegraph also played a crucial role in integrating the cotton market, reducing the influence of local middlemen and helping regional growers market their crops nationally.

The telegraph revolution had broader implications for the economy and society. It reshaped domestic markets by linking them more tightly, reducing the role of middlemen, and making national economies more integrated. This was particularly evident in the railway industry, where telegraph signals allowed for single tracking and improved transportation efficiency. The telegraph's real-time capabilities also aided in the development of financial markets, reducing the need for middlemen and arbitrageurs.

### Electricity/Telephone (1870-1920)

The transition from steam power to electricity and the subsequent integration of the telephone in the late 19th and early 20th centuries highlighted the importance of diversifying energy sources and communication methods for wealth preservation. The adoption of electricity by businesses like General Electric and the telephone by companies such as AT&T enabled remote work, improved efficiency, and created new markets for electrical appliances and communication services.

The transition from waterpower to steam power in the 19th century was significantly slowed by substantial switching costs, which led to a delay in steam adoption by about 20 years. This was due to high costs of retrofitting and scrappage, as well as the need for continual maintenance of steam engines. The study found that counties with lower waterpower potential had higher steam adoption rates, indicating that steam power was particularly advantageous in areas with limited waterpower resources. The research also highlighted that entrant firms were more likely to adopt steam power than incumbent firms, leading to a shift in the manufacturing landscape.

### Mass Production/Auto (1890-1940)

The advent of mass production techniques and the rise of the automobile industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries showcased the potential of industrial innovation to drive wealth preservation strategies. The assembly line and economies of scale introduced by Henry Ford's production methods reduced costs, increased output, and made automobiles accessible to a broader market, while also creating new opportunities for investment in automotive-related businesses and infrastructure.

### Mass Media (1920-1950)

### Computing (1950-1990)

### Internet (1990-2010)

### Mobile/Social (2007-2015)

### AI/ML (2015-present)

## Asset Classes

### Real Estate (Commercial/Residential by Location)

The online real estate investment market is forecast to grow from $15bn to $300bn by 2027, driven by technology opening up investment opportunities for retail investors through fractional online investment. The UK is a leader in supporting this growth while protecting retail investors from higher-risk investments, with the FCA consulting industry experts on promoting high-risk investments and creating protection through transparency. The Association of Real Estate Investment Platforms (AREIP) was launched to ensure investors can accurately evaluate investment opportunities and their associated risks, creating common market standards and building investor trust and liquidity. The UK regulator is not here to shut down new investment opportunities but to create protection through transparency, something they excel at. This recent consultation into alternative asset classes should be seen as an opportunity to improve them as they grow, rather than allowing a few rogue players to manipulate new investment spaces, which is what leads to high profile failures and distrust within the alternatives space.

## Conclusions

The analysis of wealth preservation strategies across major technological disruptions reveals several key patterns and insights. The telegraph revolution of the 1840s-1866 significantly improved communication efficiency, facilitating the integration of global markets and reducing the influence of middlemen. The transition from steam power to electricity and the integration of the telephone highlighted the importance of diversifying energy sources and communication methods. The advent of mass production techniques and the rise of the automobile industry showcased the potential of industrial innovation to drive wealth preservation strategies.

The online real estate investment market is expected to grow significantly, driven by technology and regulatory support. The UK's approach to regulating alternative asset classes demonstrates a commitment to protecting retail investors while fostering innovation.

The empirical patterns suggest that wealth preservation strategies should focus on diversification across asset classes and geographic locations. Timely investment decisions and effective risk management are crucial during periods of technological disruption. The analysis provides a comprehensive framework for investors to navigate these challenges and preserve wealth effectively.

6. The Re-wired Investor expects to receive advice tailored to their unique circumstances, stay in control of their financial lives, and understand the advice they receive. They are more skeptical of authority than previous generations of investors and believe in the wisdom of their peers. They expect to be able to access advice anywhere and at any time, through multiple channels and devices as part of a cohesive, rich digital experience. They perceive risk as downside, rather than volatility, and feel entitled to the same investment products and strategies available to Ultra High Net Worth (UHNW) or even institutional investors.
7. The UK has always been a leader when it comes to supporting the growth and innovation of evolving markets, whilst also protecting retail investors from higher-risk investments. The FCA recently consulted industry experts on the promotion of high-risk investments as part of a clampdown on misleading marketing in alternative asset classes. The likes of investment-based crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending agreements were under the spotlight. The UK regulator is not here to shut down new investment opportunities but to create protection through transparency, something they excel at. This recent consultation into alternative asset classes should be seen as an opportunity to improve them as they grow, rather than allowing a few rogue players to manipulate new investment spaces, which is what leads to high profile failures and distrust within the alternatives space.
