## Investment Memo: VanEck Vietnam ETF (VNM)  

### Executive Summary  

The VanEck Vietnam ETF (VNM) presents a compelling investment opportunity over the next 1 to 5 years. This memo will delve into the qualitative and quantitative metrics that align with Bill Ackman's investment philosophy, highlighting the strengths of the Vietnamese market and the ETF's composition. By focusing on management quality, business model resilience, competitive advantages, and long-term growth potential, we aim to build a bullish case for VNM.  

### Investment Philosophy  

Bill Ackman's investment philosophy has evolved from classic value investing to recognizing business quality, activism, and switching management teams to create value. Ackman emphasizes investing in high-quality, durable, simple, predictable, free cash flow generating businesses to protect against significant losses, even with concentrated positions. Key qualitative metrics include management quality, business model resilience, and competitive advantages, or 'moats.'  

### Qualitative Metrics  

#### Management Quality  

Ackman focuses on companies with dominant competitive positions and evaluates management teams based on character, intelligence, energy, and relevant experience. In the context of VNM, the underlying companies must demonstrate strong leadership capable of navigating the dynamic Vietnamese market. Vietnam's economic policies, driven by a proactive government, have fostered a business-friendly environment that attracts foreign investment and supports domestic growth.  

#### Business Model Resilience  

The resilience of a business model is crucial for long-term success. Ackman has highlighted the importance of customer satisfaction metrics, such as the 20% improvement in Lowe's customer satisfaction, which indicates a successful turnaround. In Vietnam, companies within VNM must show adaptability and innovation, particularly in sectors like technology and consumer goods, which are poised for growth.  

#### Competitive Advantages  

Ackman's focus on the 'moat' or competitive advantage of businesses is exemplified by Chipotle's strong brand loyalty, which has seen a 15% increase in repeat customers year-over-year. For VNM, identifying companies with strong brand loyalty, unique market positions, and technological advantages will be key. Vietnam's growing middle class and increasing consumer spending provide a fertile ground for businesses to establish and maintain competitive advantages.  

### Quantitative Metrics  

#### Financial Health  

Ackman emphasizes the importance of free cash flow generation and financial stability. The companies within VNM should demonstrate robust financial health, with a focus on revenue growth, profit margins, and debt management. Vietnam's economic growth, driven by exports and domestic consumption, provides a supportive environment for financial performance.  

#### Market Position  

Evaluating the market position of the underlying companies in VNM is essential. Ackman's investment in Chipotle highlights the importance of dominant market positions. In Vietnam, sectors such as technology, manufacturing, and consumer goods offer opportunities for companies to establish leading market positions.  

#### Technological Disruption  

Pershing Square has highlighted the risk of technological disruption, particularly in the restaurant industry. This principle can be applied to various sectors within VNM. Companies that embrace technological innovation and adapt to changing market dynamics will be better positioned for long-term success. Vietnam's growing tech sector and digital transformation initiatives provide a supportive environment for technological disruption.
